# EasyGrocery Project

EasyGrocery
In this project I tried to create a grocery list generator using Python language and google sheets as a database. The user would choose recipes from a selection of recipes the program would generate a grocery list with all the necessary ingredients based in the userâ€™s choice of recipes.
The program also gives the user the choice to check a stock before generating the list making the process of figuring out what ingredients should you buy and what you already have in stock a lot easier.

### Objectives:


### Changes throughout the process:

- Initially I have the idea to create a program that would have the stock database updated after an ingredient was used for a recipe, due to the limit of time and security reasons I decided to keep the data base read only.

- I had plans to give the user the option to add new recipes, but this function was also not added due to the reasons above.
